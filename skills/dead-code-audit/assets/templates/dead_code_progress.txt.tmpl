# Dead Code Progress — User Selection

How to use:
1) Mark `x` in the `Remove?` column for items you approve to delete.
2) Add context in `Notes` if needed (e.g., "external API - do not remove").
3) Then ask Codex:
   - $dead-code-audit apply from progress

Table columns:
- `Remove?`: put `x` to approve removal
- `Notes`: free text
